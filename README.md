website dedicated to detriot: become human

My project is called DBH-Website and it's a website dedicated to the game Detriot: Become Human! It is similar to a blog where I talk about my experiences playing the game! I included all three of the characters and how I felt about their path as well as some of my favourite images/clips! 

I made this project because I loved the game and wanted to do something with my experience of it! But I also wanted to further my web development experience and learn some more JS as well implement videos in my code! I decided to make this website after remembering the intro to the game and I wanted to build a site from it!

I made my project using HTML, CSS, and JS. I used HTML and CSS for structure while I then used JS to make my buttons work! I try to make it like futuristicish and I really wanted to include videos, I try to make all three of the characters have a similar layout and look for similar images to make it look cohesive.
What you struggled with and what you learned

I had a lot of trouble with the videos and then hiding the images behind it/pausing or skipping and I had to constantly check it if was working. Along with this, whenever I would remove the background of somethimg, it's space would be way larger than the actual image and I had a hard time figuring that out. The main button in particular took me a while to figure out because I needed to figure out how to place the button on it and the centering took me a while because I was trying to cover something in the video. I had a lot of ideas for this project but I had a hard time actually implementing all of them but I am really glad with how this website turned out! 

From this project, I learned how to use JS and futher advanced my html/css. I learned how to implement videos and used the margins way more. I tried to be more organized with the files and I was able to code this website far faster than my past one and I was more confident in writing my code (i didn't have to look every single thing up!) I also learned how to be patient and go through the process of debugging... 

Overall, I am proud of this site and this site serves as a personal project/tribute to the game of Detriot: Become Human. If you haven't played this game, I highly recommend you do!
