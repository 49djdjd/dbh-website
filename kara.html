        <h1>Kara (#579 102 694) </h1>
        <p>I really liked all of the characters and especially seing how all of their motivations to become "deviant" are different. I orginally didn't like Kara's story and felt that it started of a little too slow but I really liked how her story developed. I felt that compared to the other charcters, her story was more heartfelt? She became deviant to save Alice and spends the rest of the game protecting Alice and to me, this shows her emotions in a human way. Kara's change in appearence was something more than just hiding from authorities but rather her breaking away from the standard/ordinary and I love her short hair! Kara's story showed both the cruelity and the warmth of humans and we see this with Alice's abusive father but also with Rose. Her story was really well-done but something that I didn't know was that she was supposed to be the main character? Another thing that I loved about Kara was how vulnerable she was, she was really expressive in her emotions and this made her feel really humane. Although I thought the plot twist with Alice was intresting, I felt that it might be too cliche and would have been fine without! (Didn't really add too much..)</p>
