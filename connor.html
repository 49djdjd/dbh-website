        <h1> Connor (RK800 #313 248 317)</h1>
        <p>Connor was by far my favorite character to play through! I loved his path and the options avaliable! And his relationship with Hank was so well-written. So many things were determined by Connor actions and although I understood Markus story, for some reason I choose to not go deviant and continue to work for CyberLife as Connor. It did make the story really intresting because I was playing both of the characters and they were both going against eachother! I was so sad about Hank's death but I don't think that there was a way for him to survive? Also the facial expressions for Connor were so good, especially when you see him on the verge of being deviant, you see him with more human expressions rather than his usual one. (I might be wrong) but if I do replay, Connor's path would defintely be the main reason why! It was through this game that I learned that videogame characters are modelled from like real people? I always thought that they were CGI/AI so I learned something new! And this game is so advanced for its time, like it only came out in 2018 and it talks about so many of the complexices we face now with AI / Androids! I have so much I want to say about the game, but I don't really remember the plot as well as I wish I did. But if I replay it, I will definitely update this site!!</p>
